My main task was to produce a unique method that could not be easily deciphered and had a high level  of security. I have studied the way modern encryption works, specifically about the two main modern encryption standards used today, DES and AES. A major setback has been trying to to come up with an encryption algorithm that was secure enough and that could also be easy to decrypt using pen and paper so that it could be verified that the encryption is working and nu producing a string of random letters.");

The specifications of the app were: to be able to play music internally, to connect to social media, to have access to the geo-location services on the phone, to be able to share information via the internet and exchange private chat messages. I have researched extensively the legal aspects of my app at the encouragement of my tutor. Due to time constraints, the amount of research and other coding issues, the app was never developed further than a rough version. I would like to develop it further in the future as a hobby project and deploy it in the app store. Also make available to the  visually impaired and blind people.");
